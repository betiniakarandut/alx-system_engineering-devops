# 0x0F. Load balancer

## Description :house:
In this project, I learnt how to configure multiple web servers and connect them
through ssh. Also expose me to handling multiple web servers on Nginx

## Tasks :pencil:
| file | Description|
|------|------------|
|[0. Double the number of webservers](./0-custom_http_response_header) | Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)|
| [1. Install your load balancer](./1-install_load_balancer) | Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.|
| [2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet](./2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp) | Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.|
