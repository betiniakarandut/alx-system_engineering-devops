# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

## Description
In this project(Web infractructure design), I began to demonstrate my understanding of web, web server, application server, database, stack(LAMP), etcetera.
Whiteboarding was a key tool in the task demonstration.
This project contains links to diagrams representing different web infrastructures.
Its goal is to understand, on a very high-level, how web infrastructures are organized and what are their components.
